Hi, I am Daniyal Shahrokhian and my passions are Computer Science and Machine Learning. Curiosity drives me through the day, and now I am pursuing to create something relevant to the world. I am using this blog for adapting the great philosophy of [learning by teaching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_by_teaching).
